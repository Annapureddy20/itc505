        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The main idea of this research paper is to reduce the one of the problem faced by the
            workers under MGNREGA in villages. The problem is that every day a group of 30-40 members
            goes to some work, which is based on MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employee
            Guarantee Act). This work is assigned by their leader, who takes attendance on every working
            day. On this process if anyone is absent on working day, his/her will sign on the attendance sheet
            on next following day. By this, for those days that are absent to work also get money and the
            people who worked on that day will lose their money. To store the details of the workers we are
            using MYSQL data servers and HTML, CSS, PHP codes for creating the web pages. Node MCU
            module is used to access the fingerprint of the worker. After getting finger it checks for
            validation and displaying the login details of the worker. By using the biometric we can reduce
            the corruption in the MGNREGA Act. By doing this way every worker in this act will be
            benefited and satisfied for their work and money.</p>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The act was proposed by our ex-prime minister in the year 1991. It was implemented in total 525 districts in
            India. It covered all over the India in every state. This is named by government as "the largest and most
            ambitious social security and public works program in the world". The workers in this group are under a main
            leader who is appointed by the higher officials. The leader is taking the attendance of the worker even
            though
            they did not attend for the work, and the money is especially shared between them.
            Mahatma Gandhi Employee Guarantee Act 2005 (or NREGA No 42 later renamed as "Mahatma Gandhi National Rural
            Employee Guarantee Act," MGNREGA), is an Indian labor law and to give work to every citizen in India. That
            aims
            right to work for the people. This act was passed in September 2005.
            Finger plays an important role in the biometric technique. We know that every person in the world
            fingerprint
            consists of a unique pattern ridges on the surface of the finger. Instead of going to paperless work, we are
            proposing this system attendance monitoring using a fingerprint. Fingerprint module machine is one type of
            biometric attendance that uses the fingerprint of the worker to do the further activities in the device.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Workers are doing work according to the rules of MGNREGA (like digging holes for conserving rainy water,
            cutting
            unwanted trees). These workers are working under a leader. This leader tasks attendance
            at the ending of work on that day even though some persons did not attend for the work. She/he is giving
            attendance to the persons, and the money is sharing them both of them (leader & person). By doing this, the
            average
            wage of other person in the group is decreasing for the work on that day. Proposed System
            In our proposed system, we improve the procedure of taking attendance and making it easy to maintain records
            of
            each worker. Every worker's record will be automatically updated and generated after some lapse of a given
            time.

    <section id="outcome">
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>We decided to use a biometric device to recognize the fingerprint of the worker. It will take his/her
            fingerprint
            at the time of working in the field only.
            Doing this way we can remove these kinds of activities like (proxy, corruption) in the work; the fingerprint
            device is connected to the Node MCU module
            hotspot of the mobile/tab.

    <section id="workingprocedure">
        <h2>Working Procedure</h2>
        <p>First, the leader should log in using his credentials; after that, he will get the HTML page to take the
            attendance.
            While keeping the finger on the device,
            it will take the fingerprint and store it as a number in the Node MCU module.

        <h2>Final Result</h2>
        <p>After successful login, it displays that you are logged in & logged out times in the report form. It also
            contains
            the date and time of logging of the user at the end
            of work; if we place the finger twice, it displays at which time you leave from the work.</p>

    <section id="benifits">
        <h2>Benefit and Impact on Society</h2>
        <p>Mainly workers who are living in villages will benefit from this because 85% of the people in this act are
            from villages only. By doing this, the
            money is distributed equally between the workers for their work. This act is mainly used in summer because
            people
            have no work during summer. It also provides work
            to the people in the villages during the summer.</p>

    <section id="conclusions">
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>This system gives fingerprint authentication and a website with a fingerprint module. It takes
            information from the device and checks the validity of the finger
            and processes the data. This device can avoid taking attendance by paper work and cheating other persons in
            the
            work and getting attendance even though they
            did not come to the work. This module is low cost and easy to implement in the project.</p>

        <h1>Addendum</h1>
        <p>In this addendum, I provided a detailed explanation of the stylistic choices made in the accompanying CSS
            stylesheet for the given HTML document. These choices were carefully considered to enhance the visual appeal
            and readability of the document, without altering its core structure or functionality. Let's discuss each
            choice individually.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Font Choices</h2>
        <p>I opted for the font family 'Arial, sans-serif' to achieve a clean, modern, and universally readable
            appearance. This choice ensures that the document remains legible on various devices and platforms. By
            providing a fallback to a generic sans-serif font, I enhance accessibility and readability.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Sizes of Headings and Main Text Size</h2>
        <p>For the main text, a base font size of 16px was selected. This size strikes a balance between readability and
            text density, offering a comfortable reading experience.</p>
        <p>Headings were sized hierarchically to establish a clear visual hierarchy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>h1:</strong> The main title was assigned a larger font size (2em) to emphasize its importance
                and visual prominence.</li>
            <li><strong>h2 to h6:</strong> Each subsequent heading level received a progressively smaller font size
                (ranging from 2em to 1.2em). This creates a logical hierarchy in the document, ensuring clarity in the
                structure.</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <h2>Color Choices</h2>
        <p>Color choices play a significant role in the document's aesthetics and readability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Text Color:</strong> The primary text color is retained as #333 (dark gray) to maintain
                optimal contrast against the light gray background.</li>
            <li><strong>Header Background:</strong> The header boasts a distinctive background color (#dfd5d5) to
                visually separate it from the rest of the content.</li>
            <li><strong>Heading Colors:</strong> Each heading level is assigned a unique color for clear
                differentiation, contributing to visual appeal:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>h1:</strong> A distinct shade of red (#c91717) is employed to make the title stand out.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>h2:</strong> A bold blue color (#007BFF) distinguishes second-level headings.</li>
                    <li><strong>h3:</strong> Red-orange (#E44D26) provides visual contrast for third-level headings.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>h4:</strong> Turquoise (#18BC9C) is used for fourth-level headings.</li>
                    <li><strong>h5:</strong> A vibrant yellow (#FFC107) adds a touch of brightness to fifth-level
                        headings.</li>
                    <li><strong>h6:</strong> Purple (#8E44AD) is chosen to set sixth-level headings apart.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <h2>Margin and Padding Choices</h2>
        <p>Margins and padding are essential for content organization and visual clarity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Padding for the Entire Page:</strong> A padding of 20px is applied to the entire page to create
                space between the content and the page edges, enhancing visual appeal and readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin for Sections:</strong> Margins of 20px are introduced for sections to separate content
                blocks, aiding in content organization and visual clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Padding for Figures:</strong> Figures receive 20px of margin at the top and bottom for better
                alignment and separation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These stylistic choices were made with the aim of creating a visually pleasing and well-organized document.
            The font choices, heading sizes, color distinctions, and padding/margin adjustments collectively enhance the
            document's overall presentation, contributing to improved readability and an aesthetically pleasing user
            experience.</p>

        <p>These choices were made thoughtfully to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the document while
            maintaining its structural integrity.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="html-abuse-update">
        <h1>HTML Abuse Update</h1>
        <p><strong>Correction of HTML abuse:</strong> In the original version of the document, there were instances of
            HTML abuse where certain elements were chosen primarily based on visual aesthetics rather than their
            intended semantic meaning. These issues have been addressed to ensure that the HTML structure adheres to
            best practices, enhancing both document structure and accessibility.</p>

        <p>The specific changes made to rectify HTML abuse include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Replaced the use of h2 for the title of the essay with the more appropriate `h1` element. This change
                signifies the essay's title as the highest-level heading on the page, aligning with HTML's semantic
                structure and improving accessibility.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>These corrections are essential for maintaining a well-structured and accessible document, ensuring that it
            can be properly interpreted by assistive technologies and providing a more inclusive reading experience for
            all users.</p>
